## Completions Health Check
This tests against all of our properties and returns the results of all completions on all goals. It then parses that result and returns a file of those that had zero completions over the last month. In AWS, it is set to run once/month

(Some results may not be applicable as some properties may not have "Goals" created.)

To run it manually: while in your virtual environment (see above), run `python3 ./completions_health_check.py`

## Session Health Check
